# pipeline_in_machinelearning


## Difination

### [*] Sequentially apply a list of transforms and a final estimator.
### [*]  Intermediate steps of the pipeline must be ‘transforms’, that is, they must implement fit and transform methods. The final estimator only needs to implement fit.
### [*] The purpose of the pipeline is to assemble several steps that can be cross-validated together while setting different parameters
